## Part 2

Bess:

- Execution time before optimization: 0.068(mean) / 0.013(best)
- Execution time after optimization: 0.053(mean) / 0.011(best)

- Briefly describe how you optimized for this query:
  For Part 2, we added some code to index a few columns that showed up in the query. We adopted this approach because indexing can optimize the running speed of SQL queries by expediting data retrieval, query processing, joining/sorting/grouping operations, etc. & reducing I/O operations. After running the script to get the initial run time (0.068/0.013) before optimization, I identified the columns I wanted to index and implemented a "stepwise" strategy, where I index one column at a time since I was curious to see how each index affect the run time. Here's a breakdown of what I did:

  1. artist.id (0.060/0.011)
     - index on artist.id because it's used in the JOIN and GROUP BY clause (showed up twice so it was assumed indexing it would effectively reduce the run time)
     - improved running speed
  2. artist.id + track.artist_id (0.054/0.010)
     - index on track.artist_id because it's in the JOIN clause
     - improved running speed
  3. artist.id + track.artist_id + track.album_id (0.054/0.010)
     - Index on track.album_id because it's used in a JOIN clause
     - did not improve running speed, speculations as to why: the result set might be already small enough after the initial join; also the field is already mostly in asencding order
  4. artist.id + track.artist_id + track.album_id + album.album_listens (0.054/0.010)
     - index on album.album_listens because it's used in a HAVING clause
     - did not improve running speed, speculations as to why: we could index alnum.album_listens but it doesnâ€™t speed up the aggregation, it would need to scan all the rows/groups of albums for each artist to determine the minimum listens anyways
  5. artist.id + track.artist_id + track.album_id + album.album_listens + album.id (0.053/0.011)
     - index on album.id because it's in the JOIN clause
     - did not improve running speed (changes were negligible), speculations as to why: the result set might be already small enough after the initial join; also the field is already mostly in asencding order

  General observation: it's interesting that indexing only improves the average running speed, not the best running speed. This probably suggests that there's some kind of bottleneck (processing power?) that constrains how well it can perform.

Iris (she tried a different approach than mine ~Bess):

- Did you try anything other approaches? How did they compare to your final answer?

  Iris' results:

  - Execution time before optimization: 0.036
  - Execution time after optimization: 0.033

  I did try another approach by creating index for album_id and artist_id, but the Mean time of the query didn't improve as I wished. This is probably due to album_id and artist_id are both already indices (?) thus my approach is redundant and have no effect.

  (I guess we weren't sure whether the primary keys were already automatically indices in this case, even though commonly they should. I had the same question when deciding what to index. ~Bess)

  I optimized by creating a composite index on the track table with the combination of artist_id and album_id since we're running 100 times on the query but don't have a direct connection between track, artist and album table.

  (Also note that even the intial run time was already much thess than mine. Perhaps due to a difference in our machines processors? Or something else... ~Bess)
